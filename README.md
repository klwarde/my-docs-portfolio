# Documentation Portfolio

This repository contains the source files for my documentation portfolio — a place where I explore how clear structure, thoughtful information design, and Docs-as-Code practices can make documentation ecosystems easier to maintain and easier to use.

I built this site with:
- **Antora** for modular architecture  
- **AsciiDoc** for expressive, reusable content  
- **Git** for versioning and collaboration  
- **GitHub Pages** for publishing

## Why this toolset?

I chose Antora and AsciiDoc because they were the first Docs-as-Code tools that genuinely *clicked*. After trying Hugo, Jekyll, Gatsby, and other SSGs — and getting stuck each time — Antora’s documentation-centric structure finally made sense.

I first discovered Antora through Jodie Landes’ Write the Docs Portland 2025 talk,  
[**Unifying Documentation: A Tale of Two Security Giants**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcyVsZC30Ig&list=PLZAeFn6dfHplMbtJtidqFFtL7rt3ASNSR&index=11).

With ChatGPT’s help, I created tailored setup instructions and worked through the technical issues, which made the whole workflow smooth and repeatable.
