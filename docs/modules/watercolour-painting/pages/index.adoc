= Watercolour Painting Documentation
This section demonstrates my ability to structure documentation using the Diátaxis framework, applied to watercolour painting instruction.

== Documentation Structure
This watercolour guide follows the https://diataxis.fr/[Diátaxis framework]:

=== xref:tutorials/first-painting.adoc[Tutorials] 
Learning-oriented lessons that take beginners through their first painting experience.

=== xref:how-to/mix-colors.adoc[How-to Guides]
Problem-oriented guides that solve specific painting challenges.

=== xref:reference/color-wheel.adoc[Reference]
Information-oriented quick lookup materials for experienced painters.

=== xref:explanation/paper-types.adoc[Explanations]
Understanding-oriented discussions of concepts and theory.

== Why This Demonstrates Documentation Skills
* **Information Architecture**: Proper categorisation using proven frameworks
* **User Experience**: Content organised by user intent and skill level
* **Cross-referencing**: Effective linking between related concepts
* **Multi-audience Support**: Content for beginners through advanced practitioners
