= Troubleshooting Guide Sample
:page-role: sample

This sample demonstrates a structured troubleshooting guide used by support teams assisting customers with a set-top box service.

== Context
- *Audience:* Customer support agents
- *Purpose:* diagnose Bluetooth remote pairing and voice control issues
- *Original format:* Word/PDF service documentation
- *My role:* information architecture, workflow design, task structuring, document control

== Documentation Approach
This sample has been reconstructed in AsciiDoc to demonstrate:

* modular documentation practices
* semantic structure for reuse
* task-oriented troubleshooting workflows
* suitability for docs-as-code environments

The workflow prioritises common failure points to reduce call handling time and unnecessary escalations.

== Note on confidentiality
Content has been de-identified and reduced to a representative excerpt.

== Workflow

The diagnostic workflow diagram below illustrates the decision path used during live support calls.
