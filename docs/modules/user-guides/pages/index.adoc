=== Setting up an Antora Docs site
This how-to guide walks a documentarian new to link:https://docs.antora.org/antora/latest/[Antora] through the process of building a simple documentation portfolio site and publishing it to GitHub Pages. 

The guide demonstrates my ability to:

* Solve a real-world problem faced by tech writers who want to host a portfolio using Antora.
* Work with a docs-as-code toolset: VS Code, Git, AsciiDoc, Antora, and GitHub.
* Structure documentation using the link:https://diataxis.fr/[Diátaxis] framework and link:https://canonical.com/documentation[Canonical's] documentation style guide.
