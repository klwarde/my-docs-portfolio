= Create a documentation quality bubble chart in Excel
:description: Learn how to create a bubble scatter plot in Excel to visualise documentation quality patterns and identify outliers.

== Introduction

You have collated data about your documentation's quality scores, traffic, and other information. You would like a way to quickly visualise the data and find documents that differ significantly from typical patterns, for example unusually long, complex, or infrequently viewed documents.

This guide shows you how to build a *bubble scatter plot* that highlights documentation outliers using *reading time*, *sentence length*, and *page views*.

The chart helps answer questions like:

* Are outliers high-traffic pages?
* Do popular pages have quality problems?
* Which pages need a rewrite?
* Can any pages be archived?

== What you will build

The bubble chart you create in this guide will look similar to the following example.

For an explanation of what this chart communicates, see xref:understanding-bubble-chart-quality.adoc[Understanding Documentation Quality Bubble Charts].

== Step 1: Download the file

xref:attachment$Documentation-Quality-Data.xlsx[Download and open the Microsoft Excel workbook]. The workbook contains only one worksheet called *Bubble Chart*.

The sheet includes two data tables with sample quality data. Table 1 lists normal documents (not outliers). Table 2 lists outliers only.

== Step 2: Format the data

Format the data so Excel Excel reconises your tables as structured data.

. Select the Normal Docs table.
. In the *Home* ribbon, select *Format as Table*.
. Create another table in your worksheet for your outlier documentation quality data.
. Select the Outliers table.
. In the *Home* ribbon, select *Format as Table*.

== Step 3: Add your chart

. Select the three numeric columns in the normal documents table: *Reading Time*, *Sentence Length*, *Views* (no headers).
. In the *Insert* ribbon, select *Charts*. Then select *X Y (Scatter)* followed by the *Bubble* chart.
+
The chart is added to your worksheet. It has one series (*Normal Docs*).
. Right-click the chart and select *Select Data*.
. Select *Add* to add a new series.
.. Enter `Outliers` in the *Series name* field.
.. Select the *Reading Time* column (Outliers table, no headers) in the *Series X values* field.
.. Select the *Sentence Length* column (Outliers table, no headers) in the *Series Y values* field.
.. Select the *Views* column (Outliers table, no headers) for the *Series Bubble Size* field.
. Select `Series1` and choose *Edit*. Enter `Normal Docs` in the *Series name* field. Select *OK*.
. Select *OK*, then select *OK* again.
. Drag the chart to increase its size.

== Step 4: Format the chart

=== Add a Chart Title and Subtitle

. Click the current title and rename it to something insightful for the audience, like *Most docs cluster near the mean - but two stand far apart*.
. Add a subtitle *Bubble size shows page popularity (views)* so users will understand what the bubble size represents.
. Increase the font size of the title and decrease the font size of the subtitle.

=== Add a legend

. Click the chart.
. Select the `+` icon to open *Chart Elements*.
. Tick *Legend* and choose *Bottom* for the position.

=== Add Axis Titles and format Axes

. Click the `+` icon to open *Chart Elements* and tick *Axis Titles*.
. Click the x-axis title and rename it to *Average Sentence Length (Words)*.
. Click the y-axis title and rename it to *Average Reading Time (Minutes)*.
. Increase the font size of the axis titles and axis values.
. Right-click the x-axis and select *Format Axis*. Change the *Minimum* value to `0`.
. Right-click the y-axis and select *Format Axis*. Change the *Maximum* value to `40`.

=== Adjust the bubble colours and labels

. Make the *Normal Docs* series bubbles blue and set transparency to 30%.
.. Right-click a bubble.
.. Select *Fill Color* → choose blue.
.. Select *More Fill Colors* to adjust transparency.
. Make the *Outliers* series bubbles orange using the same method.
. Add document names to the bubbles.
.. Right-click a bubble in the *Normal Docs* series and select *Add Data Labels*.
.. Right-click again and select *Format Data Labels*.
.. Tick *Value From Cells*.
.. Select the column containing the document names.
.. Clear the *Y Value* and *X Value* checkboxes.
.. Set the label position to *Center*.
. Make the document names stand out. 
.. Right-click the data labels and choose *Fill* then *More Fill Colours*. 
.. Select a white fill and set the transparency to 50%. Select *OK*.

== Conclusion
You now have a bubble chart that visualises documentation quality patterns and highlights outlier pages.

This chart helps you quickly identify documents that are unusually long, complex, or low quality relative to the rest of your content set.

To continue building your documentation metrics toolkit, you can also create:

* A content freshness treemap
* A documentation complexity heatmap
* A workload waterfall chart

These visuals complement the bubble chart and help you prioritise updates, rewrites, and content strategy decisions.
