= Understanding Documentation Quality Bubble Charts
:description: Learn how to interpret a bubble scatter plot for documentation quality patterns and identify outliers.

A documentation quality bubble chart can turn raw content metrics into an immediate, visual story about the health of your documentation.

== What this chart communicates

*Core cluster*

The blue cluster shows the “steady state” documentation set - pages that sit within normal ranges for length, complexity, and traffic. 

*Where users actually go*

Bubble size shows page popularity. Large bubbles indicate high-value pages that users rely on. Small bubbles highlight low-visibility or low-impact content.

*Where your attention is needed most*

This visualisation surfaces two categories of outliers that typically signal opportunity or risk:

_High-effort, low-value content:_
A long, complex legacy integration guide with minimal traffic may be outdated and consuming unnecessary maintenance effort.

_High-traffic, low-quality content:_
A short migration guide with unusually high views may indicate gaps that frustrate users or drive support load.

*Why this matters*

This chart gives you a fast way to identify documentation that:

* requires strategic updates

* poses user-experience risk

* delivers little return on effort

* can be archived or consolidated

* deserves investment because users depend on it

It turns raw documentation metrics into actionable priorities for your team.
