== Background
I began my technical writing career in *South Africa*, documenting healthcare software. This included a medical information system used by general practitioners, and a laboratory information management system used in pathology labs. Since moving to *Australia* in 2007, I've worked across IT service management, construction project management, and IPTV. My goal is to create clear and practical documentation that helps people do their work more effectively.
